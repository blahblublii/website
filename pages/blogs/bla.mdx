*drumroll intensifies,* **Welcome** to my very first blog üíñüíñüíñ 

A little thing about me is that my first file (in any new project) is usually called `bla`. So I am following that tradition here as well.

## Note: I Appreciate You

First things first, I would like to thank oomf [@evoslayerek](https://twitter.com/evoslayerek) for supporting me in making this website (*I don't think I would've come this far without them*). I would also like to thank oomf [@cinaroIl](https://twitter.com/cinaroIl) for coming up with the stellar term `blogblublii` (*queen behaviour*). 

And all my moots (and real-life friends) that have supported me in making this website come true, I truly appreciate y'all. I'm happy that as a stan account, I have found people that are so wholesome.

As a queer person (who's also *chronically online*), I find a lot of comfort in online spaces. And being in ***somniatwt*** is one of my highlights this year.


## How I set this website up

Ok I am not sure what to write in the first blog, so I'll just give a brief overview of the challenges I faced while setting this up. 

import { Callout, Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Copies Next.js template

<Callout type="info">
Before I describe stuff, please know that I'm not a webdev expert (nor did I do prior research). So anything I say here is just my perception of these frameworks.
</Callout>


So I have worked with [React](https://react.dev/) before. It is basically used to develop frontend with a component based ideology. And [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework on top of it that handles routing and all as well. Since, I've never used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) before, I was like let's go for it. 

Anywho, I looked for templates and landed on this [one](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit).

Thoughts on the template:

- Pretty neat and ez to add stuff.
- Maybe *too* simplified. 
    - I had a hard time setting up some stuff.
- But so far, it's very suitable for my usecase.


### Setting up Home Page 

Initially I was planning to use Spotify embeds for my favourite artists but like the embeds had these ugly white corners; And I really don't know how to fix them. So I went with the table format. Honestly, I popped off because it *EATS*. 

### Drama 

Okay there were other challenges in-between and I contemplated whether this website will even be published or not. Anywho, I won't be mentioning those here (most of you probably already know from my tweets I suppose).


### Setting up the Blog

Currently writing the blog XD. Honestly, I am very comfortable with this template now that I have gone over the documentation.

</Steps>



Anywho, lemme know what to write about next. It's fun to write about stuff. I usually dance but I can't really write much about that. So it will usually be nerdy stuff like this ig.



```python
print("Byeeeeeeeeeeeee üëã")
